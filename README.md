# Numerical solution of mixed boundary problem for semilinear elliptic PDEs

**Welcome**

This is a part of the code to reproduce the numerical results from the article:

- M. Misur: On the mixed boundary value problem for semilinear elliptic equations, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 179 (2021) 162-177 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2020.08.004)

It uses a fixed point iteration scheme to solve a series of linear problems. Parallelisation is also performed using the domain decomposition.

It is coded using FreeFem++: https://freefem.org/

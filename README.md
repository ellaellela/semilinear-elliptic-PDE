# Numericla solution of mixed boundary problem for semilinear elliptic PDEs

** Welcome **
This a part of the code to reproduce the numerical results from the article:

- M. Misur: On the mixed boundary value problem for semilinear elliptic equations, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation 179 (2021) 162-177
- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2020.08.004

It is coded using FreeFem++: https://freefem.org/
